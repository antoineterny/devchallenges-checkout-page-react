## Overview

[![screenshot](screenshot.png)](https://devchallenges-checkout-page-react.vercel.app/)

It's not easy to style forms with CSS, and this was a good challenge in this regard.
Even if it's not required, I started to write a quick vanilla JS script to handle the shopping cart, and then realized it would be the perfect opportunity to build my first React app.
I had a hard time coding it, but with the help of a Mosh tutorial, I eventually found my way and I'va learnt a lot with this project.
